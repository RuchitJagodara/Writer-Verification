# Writer-Verification
# Introduction
The Writer Verification challenge is a competition that involves identifying whether a given pair of handwritten text samples was written by the same person or two different persons. In the accompanying Github repository, you will find method that we came up with but this can be done much better by making a new neural network in which layers are set on the basis of alignments and darkness of a letter but because of lack of time during the event, it was very hard to do so but will make it perfect in future.
